## **About the Project**  
The *Intelligent Waste Segregation System* is a deep learning-based project designed to tackle the inefficiencies of traditional waste management systems. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and VGG-19 architectures, the system classifies waste into three categories: recyclable, non-recyclable, and organic. Additionally, it utilizes OpenCV for real-time video analysis and a Flask-based web interface for user interaction.  

This project contributes to sustainable waste management practices, reduces manual labor, and offers scalable solutions for industries, municipalities, and households.
